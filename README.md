# Dog_Vision
In this notebook, we are building a machine learning model that will be useful in predicting the dog breed by using it's image.

1. Problem Defintion
How well can we use a Machine Learning model to create something that will help us identify the probabilities of the dog belonging to a particular breed

2. Data
This data was obtained from Kaggle notebook for Dog Vision Competition

Train.csv:
This data contains the breed and the image location of the dog
Train
This folder contains all the images thet will be used to train the model.
Test
This folder contains the images of the file that will be used for testing our model and see as to how well the model performs.

3.Evaluation
This model will be evaluated based on the probability on what breed the dog actually belongs to.
